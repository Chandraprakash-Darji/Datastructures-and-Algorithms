### Stacks - Concepts

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue has two ends (front and rear). It contains only *one pointer top pointer pointing to the topmost element of the stack*. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.    

**Some key points related to stack**    
- It is called as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books, etc.
- A Stack is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store the elements of a limited size.
- It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that order can be LIFO or FILO.
