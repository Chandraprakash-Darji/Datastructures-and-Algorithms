### Linked Lists - Concepts

*A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.*    

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.    
- **Head :** First node is head contain a link to second link useful to find linked list first node with data.
- **Link :** Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.
- **Next :** Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.
- **LinkedList :** A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

#### Linked List Representation

Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.

*As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.*
- Linked List contains a link element called first.
- Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.
- Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.
- Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.
