### Array - Concepts

An array is a linear data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations.   

For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (let’s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on.   
*Remember: “Location of next index depends on the data type we use”.*

The above image can be looked at as a top-level view of a staircase where you are at the base of the staircase. Each element can be uniquely identified by its index in the array (in a similar way as you could identify your friends by the step on which they were on in the above example). 

**Array’s size:** Arrays work on an index system starting from 0 to (n-1), where n is the size of the array. There is types of indexing of the array as given below.    
**Types of indexing in an array:**     
- **0 (zero-based indexing):** The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0.  
- **1 (one-based indexing):** The first element of the array is indexed by the subscript of 1.  
- **n (N-based indexing):** The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually, programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values, and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index.   
#### Types of Arrays

1. One dimensional array (1-D arrays)
2. Multidimensional array
