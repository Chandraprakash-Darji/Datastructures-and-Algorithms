**Properties of a Binary tree**

- A binary tree is either an empty tree or consists of a node called the root node, a left subtree, and a right subtree. The subtrees will also act as a binary tree once.
- The top-most node is called the root.
- A node without children is called a leaf node or terminal node.
- The maximum number of nodes at each level of i is 2i.
- Height of the tree = the longest path from the root node to the leaf node.
- Depth of a node = the length of the path to its root.
